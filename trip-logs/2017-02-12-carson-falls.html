		<p>A series of recent storms in the Bay Area this winter has breathed new life into the streams, creeks, and waterfalls of the region. Located just west of the town of Fairfax, the Carson Falls hike is an easy trek with some great views, provided you can beat the crowds.  Our intention this cloudy Saturday was never to hike Carson Falls. In fact, we had planned to travel 5 miles farther to hike the Cateract Falls loop, a steeper, longer hike.  Alas, we would never make it.</p>
		<p>At 8:30 am I convened with my buddy Dallas and his friend Chase at the delicious <a href="https://www.arizmendibakery.com/" target="_blank">Arizmendi Bakery</a> in downtown San Rafael. We loaded up on cookies, muffins, and pecan rolls, thinking we'd be burning crazy calories on the long hike ahead.</p>
		<p>From the town of Fairfax, we drove straight west on Bolinas Road.  About 3 miles into our drive, we ran into a dead end, with the road abruptly closed.  We'd seen some comments in the forums that the road had been closed a few months ago, but we naively assumed it would have opened back up again.  There was a small parking area with a couple of cars to the left of the road, so we pulled in.  We took a quick stroll up to the top of the hill adjascent to the parking lot where we caught a few nice views of Alpine Lake to the south.</p>
		<p>By the time we got back to our car about 15 mintues later, the lot had started to fill up, and we realized there was a trailhead across the street.  We strolled across and decided to make this our hike for the day.</p>
		<p>The hike starts out on a dirt fire road called "Pine Mountain Road." The road contiues for about a mile and climbs up about 400'.  During the climb, we were treated to some spectacular views of rolling Marin hillsides covered in mist.  It is also on this leg of the hike that we saw our first of at least four signs letting us know that the endangered Yellow Bellied Frogs made this place their home.</p>
		<p>At the top of the climb, a sign pointing towards Carson Falls directed us to the left where we folloed a 500' descent into a lusher, more wooded scenery.  About 1.7 miles in from the trailhead, we reached Carson Falls. Carson Falls is actually more a series of 2-3 20'-30' waterfalls that cascade down about 100 feet.  We loitered here for a few minutes, deciding what to do next.  We found a map near the bottom of the falls that showed a less developed trail leading back to the main road - an attractive option to us as the main trail had becone nore crowded.</p>
		<p>We backtracked about 0.2 miles, then took a turn off to the right for "Old Sled Trail".  This was a great move, as the crowds instantly dissapeared and we once again had the Marin hillsides to ourselves.  We stayed on this trail for another mile or so until it met back up with the road.  From there it was just another mile on the road until we were back at our cars.</p>
